The development of cryptocurrency as a mainstream financial instrument has become more and more apparent within the last 10 years. As such a comparison of its behaviours, changes and trends to traditional financial instruments may be examined. In this project a comparison of multiple cryptocurrencies and stock prices from the New York Stock Exchange will be undertaken in order to investigate the potential underlying causes of these changes.
